    <h4> Scratch is a visual programming language designed to help those ages 8-16 learn to code. Users can create online projects using a block-like interface and add sprites or sounds to enhance their work. Scratch is a program developed by the MIT Media
        Lab and has become popular with all ages around the world.</h4>

            <h3>This activity was my first coding project, and I learned a lot from it. Coming up with the initial outline of the app was difficult at first, but it got easier over time. I gained a lot of insight about coding through this project and the
                importance of small details. Just one incorrect part of your code can make your project dysfunctional. I would advise a first-time programmer to carefully create every part of their code and periodically check their work to make sure everything
                functions properly.</h3>

            <h3><br><br>I found this project to be much easier than my Shopping Experience project. I worked on this project with a partner, which also made creating the game easier. We did have some difficulties getting everything to function, but we were
                able to work them out. Creating this game helped me to realize how much work goes into creating games. I would advise a first-time programmer to create everything carefully and to not get too frustrated if their code does not work the
                way they want it to. Instead, they should take a break, come back later and inspect their code carefully for errors. </h3>
