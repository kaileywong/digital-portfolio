    <h4> HTML, which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is the standard language for creating web pages and applications. It is used to describe the structure of a web page and can be used in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.
        HTML elements are represented by tags. Browsers such as Safari or Chrome can use these tags to render the content of a page.</h4>

            <h3>This assignment was an introduction to HTML and through fixing the code, I became aware of common mistakes in HTML. Such mistakes include spelling errors and not including the folder when inserting a picture. This assignment also taught me
                how to format text, such as bolding, italicizing, sizing, and coloring. I also learned how to insert and resize pictures. I would advise a first-time programmer to type all their code carefully and double-check to make sure every character
                is correct.</h3>

            <h3><br><br><br>This assignment taught me how to make a div table and use CSS to style different elements of my webpage. I also discovered how use an image as a background and make elements transparent. I did have some difficulty getting the table
                to work, but after I figured it out, the rest was easy. I would advise a first-time programmer to use available resources to help them with their coding, such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">
        		w3schools.com</a>. Additionally, they should not be afraid to experiment and have fun while creating a web page.</h3>
